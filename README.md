# Git Practice

* Clone this repo: https://github.com/Joshua-Miles/git-practice-060120
> `git clone https://github.com/Joshua-Miles/git-practice-060120`

* Create a branch to make changes on
> `git branch Leonie`

* Checkout (tell git to use) that branch
> `git checkout Leonie`

* Change the code. Find your file/method. It currently takes in a string, and returns it. Change the method to alter the string in any way

* Once you've changed your method, save your code back to github in 3 steps:
```
git add .
git commit -m "a message describing what you've done"
git push
```

* Go to GitHub, select your branch, and create a pull request
